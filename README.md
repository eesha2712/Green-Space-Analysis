# Green-Space-Analysis
This project is an interactive Streamlit web app that analyzes green space accessibility in cities. Users input a city name, and the app fetches city boundaries, parks, and population data. It performs buffer analysis around green spaces, visualizing the results on an interactive map, highlighting underserved areas lacking green space access.
